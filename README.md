# selenium-tf

This is a solution to an educational task which is an essential part of testing course in HSE (formerly SPbAU). It contains a simple "business" app using selenium and tests to it, where the tests are the main part of the task.

1. It's a InteliJ IDEA project
2. root:root MUST be credentials for test account on YouTrack
3. My variant are kinda boring, we can create almost any issue, so keep that in mind evaluating my test creativity
